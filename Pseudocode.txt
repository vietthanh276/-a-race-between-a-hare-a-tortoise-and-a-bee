This pseudocode outlines the structure of a program simulating a race between a tortoise, hare, and bee.

In main:
    Initialize variables (current_position_hare, current_position_tortoise, current_position_bee, winner, prevWinner)
    
    Prompt user for a random number seed
    Get seed from the terminal and use it to seed the random number generator
    Set the current position animals to 0 (at the starting line).
    
    int winner = -1  // Initialize an irrelevant winner
    
    Start the race:
    Loop for a specified number of time steps (e.g., 500):
        Update the positions of the hare, tortoise, and bee using respective update functions (update_hare, update_tortoise, update_bee)
        Check and update the winner based on the current positions (Use an integer variable to keep track of who is winning (0 = tortoise, 1 = hare, 2 = bee))
        
        Set the prevWinner = -1 // Initialize an irrelevant prevWinner
        if winner is not equal to the previous winner (a new animal is in the lead):
            Print "At t = time, the animal (square current_position) has taken the lead." to the terminal
            Update the prevWinner variable
            
        Check if any animal has reached the finish line (square 70) (current_position >= 70):
            Print "After current_time seconds, the [winner's name] wins!!" to the terminal
            Break out of the loop if a winner is found
    
    Return 0

int update_hare(int current_position):

    // Determines the new position of the hare after 1 second
    // Parameters:
    // current_position: the current location of the hare
    // Returns:
    // The new position of the hare

int update_tortoise(int current_position):
    // Determines the new position of the tortoise after 1 second
    // Parameters:
    // current_position: the current location of the tortoise
    // Returns:
    // The new position of the tortoise

int update_bee(int current_position):
    // Determines the new position of the bee after 1 second
    // Parameters:
    // current_position: the current location of the bee
    // Returns:
    // The new position of the bee
